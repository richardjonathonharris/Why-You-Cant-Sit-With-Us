# Why You Can't Sit With Us -- Understanding Network Analysis in Python with Mean Girls

Network analysis is a handy tool used to understand group dynamics, provide product recommendations, and prevent homicides (and other things). This talk will introduce the theory behind network analysis and showcase the flexibility of Python's NetworkX library. No knowledge of network analysis (or Mean Girls) is needed, but basic knowledge of Python and the iPython Notebook, will be helpful. 

This repository includes the presentation (in reveal.js), some data used to generate inferences, and iPython Notebooks containing example code. I recommend creating a virtualenv and installing the packages in requirements.txt

Presentation given at:

* PyOhio 2015 (Columbus, Ohio)
* ChiPy (Chicago, IL)
